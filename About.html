                            I know this isn't a good picture. But even in its grainy, partially overexposed, partially over-contrasted badness, you can see the twinkle in my eyes and the happiness in my smile. This is the epitome of what my art is. I create so that people can create their own inner story of what this work means to them so that they discover new truths about themselves to unlock a better, higher version of themselves. My art is about this level of personal and universal transcendence to create a better world.

                            The will to help is what my artistic styling embodies, and it uses personal and universal experiences to do so. Each piece possesses the epiphanic, wondrous brilliance of childhood. Even when I speak of darker moments and deeper issues it is through the eyes of a child that views the world almost as an outsider with unrelenting optimism and a magical belief in faith. There is no light without darkness and no darkness without light.

                            I believe in a universal connection. We all think of God, life, death, religion, family, truth, love, relationships, marriage, career, fun, and it is these experiences that help connect people. More so, I believe it's the privilege of artists to be able to reflect on life, that only the most privileged have the opportunity of experiencing. This makes it the responsibility of the artist to tackle the issues of humankind to help make this world a better place.
